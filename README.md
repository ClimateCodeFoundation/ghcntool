# GHCN Tool

A collection of tools to work with data from Global Historical
Climate Network (GHCN).

# Status

As of 2014-07 these have just been split from
ClimateCodeFoundation/ccc-gistemp and dumped here. Consequently,
many of the tools don't run without having various directories
and modules from ccc-gistemp made available to them.

We intend to fix that situation, so that the tools here work
standalone, or almost so.

`stationplot.py` should work (unless you use the `-a` or `-y`
option).
